## Recruitment Process

Our recruitment process follows these simple steps:

- **Application** - We will review the application and get in direct contact with the applicant and inform him about the process.
- **Interview** - The applicant get invited to teamspeak to an Interview. This is mainly to get in contact and give further information and instructions.
- **Confirmation** - Once the Interview is done we will confirm the applicant and officially invite him.
- **Preparation** - The applicant will use the given details and instructions to download our modset.
- **Mentoring** - Once the applicant has a working modset he will be invited to a mentoring session. We will assess his knowledge and skills and bring him up to our standard individually or in small groups. That ensure a smooth transition into our group. Also it allows to individually teach people which allows us to take people with various different skill levels without teaching things they already know or teach them advanced things without them having the basics.

## Installing Mods

The first thing you need to do when you join us is to start downloading the modset. We use the Steam Workshop for distribution. The exact collection and installable preset can be found in a pinned message on our Discord.
Also note that the ACRE mod requires you to also install a teamspeak plugin. This plugin will attempt to install automatically when first launching the game with our modset enabled.

## ACE 3 Mod

ACE 3 is a mod that brings a lot of aspects to the game in regards of simulating reality. Generally if you are not familiar with it, it is recommended that you familiarise yourself with it before your first session. Note that we use a lot of customizations and enhancements.

## ACRE Mod

Being able to use the radio is essential. Make sure to read the [communication section](/handbook/communication) of the handbook.
