## Introduction

More often than not our operations are conducted by a diverse force. While everything is centered around the Infantry Platoon as the core of our force, there can be a variety of support oriented units serving alongside it.

All elements like Aviation, Reconnaissance, Armour or other Support Units are purely around to support and assist the Infantry Platoon. This section is describing the general relationship and responsibilities.

## Platoon Sergeant / Forward Air Controller

- **Doctrine** - Connective tissue between the Infantry Platoon and its leader to the Support Elements.
- **Communication** - Equipped with a Long-Range-Radio he is responsible for the communication between the Infantry Platoon and Support Elements which are not in proximity of the Platoon.
  - **Direct** - When directing tasks and request fire support, he is responsible to ensure that no friendlies or civilians are being hurt.
  - **Report** - Reports status and upcoming actions by the Infantry Platoon and Support Units to keep all involved up to speed.
  - **Review** - Reviews and reports back effectiveness on support requests.
- **Coordination** - He coordinates the actions and assignments of the Support Elements in support of the Infantry Platoon.
- **Decisions** - He is authorized to make decisions in regards on how to deploy the Support Elements based on the directives given by the Platoon Leader.
- **Execution** - Platoon Leader has ultimate authority. Once the Platoon Leader issues an order on how he want to have Support Elements deployed, it is on the Platoon Sergeant to execute the order.
- **Advisement** - He may advise and suggest Support Element usage to the Platoon Leader. While he has room to make individual calls and deploys Support Elements alongside operational guidelines. 

The Callsign for the Platoon Sergeant on the Command Net is "Central" in order to prevent confusion with the Platoon Leader himself.

## Echo Platoon Support

- **Embedded** - Echo is embedded in the main Platoon. They are handled as a regular squad, but with a special set of purpose and capabilities.
- **Backline Support** - Echo is not a direct frontline units, although in certain situations the might be used as such. They carry heavy weaponry aimed at providing fire support and flank support. In addition, the Combat Engineer may be called individually if needed.
- **Holding a Sector** - Echo is often used to hold a sector reliably due to their heavy weaponry.
- **Punching Through** - If Echo is Motorized or Mechanized they might be used in certain situations to punch through which will put them ahead of everyone else. This is a situational decision.
